# CSCI 6120 Compilers - Syllabus
# Learning Outcomes
I aim to gain a solid understanding of compilers and walk away with strong foundation in compiler design and implementation. The way I plan to do it is by implementing a project as my final project for the class. 

1.  **Understanding Compiler Structure**: - - Develop a strong understanding of the major components of compilers, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
    
2.  **Programming Language Theory**: Apply programming language concepts and theory in the process of writing a compiler, enhancing both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
    
3.  **Compiler Optimization Techniques**: Gain in-depth knowledge of compiler optimization techniques and loop transformations, inspired by collaborative research presentations with my classmates, Jason and Ian, in the "Intro to Research" course.
    
4.  **Practical Compiler Construction**: Undertake a hands-on project, such as developing a simple interpreter for a subset of Lua or a compiler for a subset of C, to solidify practical compiler construction skills.
   
   These goals will be expanded more at week 3 or 4. after more time has been spent on understanding of the course material.

<!-- Once you are done with your timeline, please go back to your learning outcomes (research questions / goals), and wonder: are you giving you enough time to complete them all? Did new learning outcomes emerge from your timeline? If your mapping from weeks to learning outcomes, or from learning outcomes to weeks is partial, then something is wrong.-->

<!--
List the resources you plan on using, ideally with precise bibliographical references and / or links.
Be specific: don't go on listing all the textbooks ever written on compilers, but refer precisely to e.g., Chapters or Sections of various material. Ideally, you could even tie those references back to your learning outcomes and (transitively) to your timeline.
